# Express Site
A Simple Express Site developed with Jade, Bootstrap, ExpressJS, NodeJS and Node Mailer.

## Getting Started
To get you started you can simply clone the ExpressSite repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the ExpressSite repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

I also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test ExpressSite. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone ExpressSite

Clone the ExpressSite repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/methewguda/ExpressSite.git
cd ExpressSite
```

If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/methewguda/ExpressSite.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.
